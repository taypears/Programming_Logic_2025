To debug Lab12 using the provided `launch.json`, ensure the following steps are completed:

1. **Verify .NET SDK Installation**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system. You can check by running `dotnet --version` in your terminal.

2. **Check Project Build**: Ensure the `Lab12` project builds successfully. Run the following command in the terminal from the workspace folder:
    ```bash
    dotnet build Lab12
    ```

3. **Update the `program` Path**: The `program` path in your `launch.json` references `${input:lab12a}.dll`, but there is no `lab12a` input defined. Update the `program` path to directly reference the DLL file for Lab12:
    ```jsonc
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/Lab12/bin/Debug/net9.0/Lab12.dll"
    ```

4. **Launch Debugging**:
    - Open the Debug panel in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS).
    - Select the `Launch Lab12` configuration.
    - Click the green "Start Debugging" button or press `F5`.

5. **Optional - Add Missing Input**: If you intended to use `${input:lab12a}`, define it in the `inputs` section:
    ```jsonc
    {
         "type": "pickString",
         "id": "lab12a",
         "description": "Select the DLL to debug",
         "options": [
              "Lab12"
         ]
    }
    ```

//After making these adjustments, you should be able to debug Lab12.
